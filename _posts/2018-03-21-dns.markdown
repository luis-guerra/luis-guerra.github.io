### [](#header-3) Configuring Bind

Bind is the most widely used DNS software on the internet.
Installing Bind is easy:
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install bind9
```

The Bind configuration directory is **/etc/bind/**.
The file **named.conf.local** is the one used to add and define **zones**.
In this case we'll add just one zone:

```bash
zone "m8dawuf3.net" {
  type master;
  file "db.m8dawuf3.net"
}
```

Notice that we specified a file that doesn't exist yet. This file stores the records of the zone. We'll copy the original local file and edit it accordingly:

```bash
cp db.local db.m8dawuf3.net
```

The next step is to change the default DNS server on our own server, we do this by editing the **resolv.conf** file under **/etc/**.
We have to leave only this line on the file so it points to our own DNS:
```bash
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

We can restart the service with:
```bash
service bind9 restart
```

Now we'll create a reverse domain lookup.
We need to edit the file **named.conf.local** once again, in order to add the reverse zone:

```bash
zone "m8dawuf3.net" {
  type master;
  file "db.m8dawuf3.net"
}

zone "192.in-addr.arpa"{
  type master;
file "/etc/bind/db.192"
}
```

Now we copy the original reverse file:
```bash
cp db.127 db.192
```

And edit it so it looks like this:

We should restart the service once again in order for the changes to be implemented.
