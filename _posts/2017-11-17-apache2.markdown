## [](#header-2) Directives & Files

I created two directories: web1, and web2 and created 2 html files inside the two directories, one public and one private

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
mkdir web1
mkdir web2

cd web1/
echo "public content" > public.html
echo "private content" > private.txt

cd ..

cd web2/
echo "public content" > public.html
echo "private content" > private.txt
```

![public1]()
![private1]()

In the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory we can find a file called `000-default.conf`. With this file we can make directives to the default virtual hosts of the web server. Some of these directives can be:

- **Directory** -> Enclose a group of directives that apply only to the named file-system directory and sub-directories
- **Location** -> Applies the enclosed directives only to matching URLs
- **Files** -> Contains directives that apply to matched filenames

We can change this file and add a <Files> restriction to all the files called `"private.txt"`. As we can see, we can't really access the file or even look for it in the file browser:
