### [](#header-3)  Configuring HTTPS on Apache2

To start using HTTPS with out Apache server, we'll need to install openssl first


```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install openssl
```

We should store our certificates somewhere, in this case it'll be under the directory `/root/`. We can generate a private key using oppenssl's `genrsa` command:

```bash
cd /root/
openssl genrsa -des3 -out daw2.key 1024
```

We can generate a CSR with the following command:

```bash
openssl req -new -key daw2.key -out server-csr
```

When generating a certificate, it will asks for for information about the signer.

Once done, we can auto sign our created certificate with the following command:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server-csr -signkey daw2.key -out daw2.crt
```

We now copy both the key and the certificate on under the ssl directory `/etc/ssl`

```bash
cp /root/daw2.key /etc/ssl/private/daw2.key
cp /root/daw2.crt /etc/ssl/certs/daw2.crt
```

To thest the certificate, I made a virtual host under the directory `/var/www/ssl` and just copied a test index.html under it.

Now we can configure the virtual host to use the certificate and the key on its configuration file:

**SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/daw2.crt**
**SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/daw2.key**

The last step, is to enable our virtual host with `a2ensite` and the apache ssl module with `a2enmod ssl`.

All that's left to do is to restart the Apache2 service and update our host machine hosts' file in order to use HTTPS with our new virtual host.
