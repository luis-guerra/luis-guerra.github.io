## Welcome to my blog!
This is the first post of (hopefully) many.
This Blog will be used as a memo-like diary online for myself.

So the first step is done:
- [x] Make a Jekyll Blog using Github Pages
- [ ] Actually fill it with useful information
- [ ] Become good at programming

Looks like `I` have a `long` way to go if i want to achieve my goals.

Technologies I am interested in:
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- Deep Learning
- Ruby
